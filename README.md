This README comments how to use the file "run_analysis.R"

To use it you have only to download it in the same folder
as you have downloaded the file "Dataset.zip". 

After being downloaded, you have to load:

```{r}
source("./run_analysis.R")
```
And that's all. The script will run alone. When it finished
all the data will be in your environment.
